    <p>Welcome to Chamecat's Antique Shop! I have been concerned with this page for a long time. After my consideration, finally I have made this decision. Just use this page as the new guild's main page! So here I am, and be with you. I decided to name the new guild(though we call it "Free company" in the game) after "Chamecat's Antique Shop". Take it easy my friend, it means nothing in fact. And here we never use "English", but Chiglish first(I can't use Chinese in the fucking Jekyll).</p>
