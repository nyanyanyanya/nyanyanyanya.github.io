Welcome to Chamecat&apos;s Antique Shop! I have been concerned with this page for a long time. After my consideration, finally I have made this decision. Just use this page as the new guild&apos;s main page! So here I am, and be with you. I decided to name the new guild(though we call it &quot;Free company&quot; in the game) after &quot;Chamecat&apos;s Antique Shop&quot;. Take it easy my friend, it means nothing in fact. And here we never use &quot;English&quot;, but Chiglish first(I can&apos;t use Chinese in the fucking Jekyll).
